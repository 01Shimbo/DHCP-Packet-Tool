Looks for DHCP requests and will allow you to send a fulfilment packet to the device requesting an IP address. The purpose of this tool is to allow a Network Admin to assign an IP address to a device that may be in a black hole network that has no access to a DHCP server. the device may be untrusted and not able to be signed an IP address locally.
